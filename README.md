# High-performance libraries for working with N-body data

This package includes a number of high-performance libraries intended to facilitate certain workflows
for n-body simulation data, particularly in cosmology.

## Rasterizer

The [rasterizer](rasterization/) library is a Vulkan-based GPU rasterization library intended to help
compute 3d density fields from point-cloud data.
